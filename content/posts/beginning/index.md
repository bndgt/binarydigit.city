Finally, a start to the garden I've been meaning to tend to.

In the beginning of 2024, I read the popular blog post by Maggie Appleton regarding [digital gardens](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) - an online space that can be considered a personal wiki, knowledgebase, notebook, or anything that collects data in your own organized way. I started the concept of a "digital cafe", where I had a cute .cafe domain, but it ended up just being a blog and a bit linear. I then bought a million domains, each with new ideas, and went a bit scattered for many months in order to distract myself.

It's now the end of the year, and I want to revisit the idea of creating a garden, with a cute theme, where I can gather all of my scattered thoughts into one place. It doesn't have to be neat, or make sense, just a proper home where I can collect all of the projects I've been working on seperately, such as saving links, drawings, cute illustrations, a collection of what books I'm into, shows/movies that I watch, games that I play, and code that I tinker with.

 If I get into a rhythm, maybe this will even be the focus of a new main website, and the blog will be a subdomain of this. I won't get ahead of myself yet though, since I get excited when I start something new. ðŸ˜† ðŸŒ±
