I love waking up in the mornings, making a cup of coffee, and seeing what Twitch streams are online. Today I noticed the thumbnail of the [OldTimeyComputerShow](https://www.twitch.tv/oldtimeycomputershow) channel and it featured Leo Laporte, to my joy, along with Patrick Norton, on TechTV. I absolutely loved when we had this channel at home (I was fortunate to grow up in a cable TV house) and it brings me back to my adult youth. This episode was aired in 2001 and was talking about computer firewalls and privacy online. How the times haven't changed much ðŸ˜‚ I wonder if these episodes are available on the internet archive?

Edit: [THEY ARE!](https://archive.org/search?query=techtv)

I did find some Revision 3 content so I'll check out if they have TechTV, my ultimate favorite nerd show. And yes I do follow everyone in their different endeavors who came out of TechTV current day!

Time to lose all my time on the archive downloading episodes :D
