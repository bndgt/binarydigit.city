The goal I've had for 20 years is complete! It's taken everything through every job I've had, part time, full time, during unemployment months, using savings, when I lived overseas in the UK, when I lived on my own, when I lived with my parents, when I lived with roommates. Every month for 20 years I paid a student loan payment - even when if it was a small amount.

That burden is now GONE! Yesterday I made my final payment and today it cleared! ðŸ¥³ðŸ˜­

I have a sense of peace that I can't really describe. True freedom and happiness is being debt free (at least until if I start a home mortage or car loan again! ðŸ¤£). I need to enjoy this for as long as possible. It's given me hope to be more financially prepared for the future and I finally feel put together. I guess it's never too late achieve a goal huh?

I celebrated yesterday with a fun DJ stream too! I was very grateful for anyone who tuned in to hang out and vibe with me!
