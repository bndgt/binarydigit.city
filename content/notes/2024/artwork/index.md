I'm scared to put my art out there into the world. Even on the fediverse or my own website, people might steal. I recently read about it on a friend's blog. Do I post it to my current blog or here? I think adding it here to my garden/notes site gives me a little bit more freedom to really be my own. Even with blog services that I've tried this past year, there's not an easy way to download my content easily. And with something like photography or art, at least I can control it with my own static site generator on hosting that I can somewhat control (either on my own VPS or Neocities). I might keep it here until I really do self-hosting from my house or a data center I physically visit. ðŸ˜†
