I'm back on Hugo, to the surprise of no one. ðŸ˜† I really enjoy tinkering with 11ty so no doubt I'll use that for other projects. For this site what I realize is that I absolutely love this theme and the customization of it all. [Blowfish](https://blowfish.page) is incredible and comes with a lot of built in options! Now that I've tinkered with both 11ty and Hugo, I'm more familiar with file layouts, tinkering with the code, and am able to have a clearer vision of where I want my site to go. I think I'll make another series for photos, projects, games etc, or keep them organized with tags and/or categories. I'll eventually venture into customizing a layout or partial and really make it my own.

I'm able to make this site more image heavy since I love color, creating backgrounds with Canva, posting images and making it fun all around. The theme has image optimization built in so I might as well take advantage of it. This website is not for the low bandwidth and I'm ok with that for a personal website. Be warned if on mobile. ðŸ˜… 

I've started up Giscus comments again along with a "send a message" dropdown section for a [Letterbird](https://letterbird.co/binarydigit) contact form. I subscribed for the year to show them support since I love how easy it is to embed and customize the form anywhere on the site, any webpage and it's built in Scribbles.

I also realize that when I'm ready to create for this website, I'll take the time to open up my code editor and create a feature image, markdown, and write a proper post or article. The fast blogging will be kept on my [Scribbles notes blog](https://notes.binarydigit.cafe), which is perfect. You can visit there for my daily/weekly blog posts! I'm a lifetime member there so have have other Scribbles blogs for other purposes. ðŸ’›
