For these next upcoming weeks, these are the goals I have in my head:

## Personal Site (here)
- Create a /uses page
- Start my Friday series that I used to do on my old micro blog called "Link List Friday" with cool links I've found that week
- Maybe convert to 11ty if I like how my other site turns out

## Professional/Portfolio Site 
(What do I even call this?)... A career site? Porfolio site?
- Keep learning 11ty and add webmentions and/or comments
- Start writing up a timeline to make a psueudo resume for myself (but don't be too detailed), yet still make it fun and "me"
- Remind myself that I don't want to go back to the corporate world. The job I haven't isn't so "corporate" but I still want to do cool fun creative things. I have no idea what that means for me.

## Offline Things
- Start to draw again. Paper/marker pencil, or iPad. I'll try both but I need to use my brain in ways without text.
- Take photos, even if they are of boring things in the house. Practice the basics, practice lighting. 
- Use my walking pad more

Is this alot? I suppose, but writing it down helps :D
