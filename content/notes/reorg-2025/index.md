I'm reorganizing my articles since it's been a year that I've tinkered with my own site. I need to update my old notes to make sure they don't point to incorrect URLs, but for now creating a little archive folder helps. Since this year is a bit ukknown and I might need to cut a few costs, I'm preparing this website so that I can run things inexpensively and on a free hosting area whether it be Netlify, Github pages, my own VPS, or whatever hosting I can control easily. 

As of today, most of my blog posts are at [blog.binarydigit.city](https://blog.binarydigit.city) until then.
