 <p><br />I&#39;ve never successfully done any of these challenges such as photo a day or blogging a day, but why not give it a try right? My posts will be small and probably not mighty, just random links or apps that I like, a photo that I took, or a new song or playlist that I&#39;m working with.

It&#39;s good to keep busy even while I&#39;m working, and I have a lot going on this month, so it should fuel some thoughts at the very least! I'll be posting mainly on my small Scribbles blog for this month.
