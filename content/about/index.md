## Organization

I'm going to use Maggie Appleton's [categorization technique](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history#:~:text=This%20could%20be%20with%20a%20simple%20categorisation%20system.%20I%20personally%20use%20an%20overly%20horticultural%20metaphor):

ðŸŒ± Seedlings for very rough and early ideas

ðŸŒ¿ Budding for work that's cleaned up and clarified

ðŸŒ³ Evergreen for work that is reasonably complete

## Colophon

This site is powered by the SSG [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and [Blowfish](https://blowfish.page). It's perfect for a mix of organization and extremely well done templating. 

I use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to edit and host it on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). My code is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/bndgt/garden/).

I subscribe to [Canva](https://canva.com) to edit the feature images and illustrations throughout the site.

The animated plant and leaf emoji are from [Google's Noto Emoji](https://googlefonts.github.io/noto-emoji-animation/).

My avatars - girl with computer and floppy disk are commissioned from the talented artist [heyheymomo](http://www.heyheymomo.com/)! Commissions done via [Ko-fi shop](https://ko-fi.com/heyheymomo).
