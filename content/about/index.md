## About Me

I was born in New York City and grew up on Long Island. I went to college to get my bachelors in Computer Science and find my way into a career of tech support, product training, systems engineering, and web development. For ten years I worked in television media as a technical support engineer and product trainer for hardware and software, working with TV stations all across the USA, and UK. After living in London for three years I came back home to New York and worked for a managed services provider as a systems engineer specializing in Windows Server and virtualization technology with clients all along the east coast. In my spare time I had the pleasure of writing articles and gadget reviews over at The Gadgeteer.

In 2017 I pivoted to become a full time web developer and found my current place of work where I started as an associate and part time developer. In 2021 I took a part time game development course via Code Coven to learn the foundations of Epicâ€™s Unreal Engine and really enjoyed learning game making, design, and networking with folks from all over the world. Today Iâ€™m the digital director for a talented team of editors, writers, and developers in the health and wellness space.

In my spare time I like to tinker with code on my personal websites, livestream music mixes and games, practice photography when I travel, and am interested in cyber security. I plan to build this website as a digital garden based on my experiences in tech, creative projects, hobbies, and notes from all aspects of my life.
