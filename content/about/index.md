This site is powered by the SSG [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and [Blowfish](https://blowfish.page). It's perfect for a mix of organization and extremely well done templating.

I'm going to use Maggie Appleton's [categorization technique](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history#:~:text=This%20could%20be%20with%20a%20simple%20categorisation%20system.%20I%20personally%20use%20an%20overly%20horticultural%20metaphor):

ðŸŒ± Seedlings for very rough and early ideas

ðŸŒ¿ Budding for work that's cleaned up and clarified

ðŸŒ³ Evergreen for work that is reasonably complete
