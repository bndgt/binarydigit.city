Iâ€™m Liz, a tech director who loves the small web, tinkering with code, photography, travel, and gaming. I grew up when the internet was young and got my first PC in the late 90s. I became fascinated with how computers worked, how the web evolved, and started being online a bit too much! You can read more [about](/about/) me or find me on [Mastodon](https://allthingstech.social/@liz) and [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/liz.computer).
