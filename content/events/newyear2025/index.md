### Year in Review

_Tell us about your journey this year. What were the highlights and memories you made along the way? What did you learn and experience? Were there any goals you set and achieved? What has it made you want to achieve for the new year?_

**This will basically be a repost of what's on my current blog, but I had a big year of mostly "yays" in 2024. I wrote the following last month:**

Itâ€™s currently December 31, 2024 around 10pm and Iâ€™m home with my partner and 2 sweet dogs. Weâ€™re in a Discord hangout, which is bascially us and a handful of friends who like to do our own things, but together - my favorite pastime really. I just mixed some music, another friend is playing CoD Zombies with my boyfriend, and another person is eating second dinner. This year has been a mix of good and bad, and Iâ€™ll reflect on the happy - a year of yays!

- In Feburary I finally accomplished the goal I never thought Iâ€™d do - paid off my student loans. Twenty years in the making, and Iâ€™m finally done. Iâ€™m still in disbelieve even after all these months. ðŸŽ‰

- I took my health more seriously and finally got myself the surgery I needed to remove a cyst in my ovary. I chose a good doctor and got it done, and Iâ€™m feeling really good!

- Staying on the taking my health more seriously train, I lost 15 pounds. I went from pre-diabetic to not, and Iâ€™m very grateful. My mom is diabetic and I know the struggle of keeping yourself within levels and taking pills and insulin, along with the dangers that come if you donâ€™t manage it well. I really donâ€™t want to deal with that if I donâ€™t have to!

- I got a proper haircut. As in - a salon. It felt great and I cut off all of my old dyed brown hair. Itâ€™s natural and healthy and I feel great!

- I saw two of my favorite pop stars in concert - Janet Jackson and Missy Elliott. Amazing!

- Weâ€™ve had three friends visit us in Michigan, and Iâ€™m so Incredibly grateful for them to make the big drives from Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Canada!

- I started a newsletter and find it fun! Iâ€™m a bit slow with it so thank you for your patience if you signed up - Iâ€™ll write more soon.

- I closed my Twitter account. Sad but also good for my soul as it was time. 

- I went to TwitchCon and although got sick, was able to enjoy a full day with friends, along with a dinner. I also went to a retro video game show and met a local streamer who was lovely!

- I took more photos than before and posted them to this blog. I need to do that more and more.

- I started to draw again and hope to continue to do so in my free time and on stream. I want to share it with the world. I also bought the book The Aristsâ€™s Way and joined a discord with other artists to discuss our journeys together. Iâ€™m really excited to get more creative.

- Iâ€™ve let domains expire and have consolidated to 3. A goal for 2025 is to not buy a single domain, so please keep me accountable :)


### Light in Darkness

_What's getting you through these cold, dark (or if you're in the Southern Hemisphere these hot, entirely too bright) months. What is the lighthouse guiding you to shore through the tumultuous waves of life?_

Hope is the number one thing getting me through the cold and dark here in the midwest. I've been having the winter blues, but I make sure to step away from my computer, look outside, and plan for new trips, even if they are a card ride, or a visit to see family, so that I can keep my mind fresh and my cabin fever away. I am saving my money as I can in case my job falls through this year, but I know I'll pick myself up with hobbies and a new gig if that's ever the case. Sometimes a door closes and another one opens at the same time.



Thank you for reading and I hope you have the very best 2025 possible. It will be an interesting year so I hope to focus on the things I can control and keep my head up. Stay safe and hope you all have a healthy new year!
