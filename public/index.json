I went to college to get my bachelors in Computer Science and find my way into a career of tech support, product training, systems engineering, and web development. For ten years I worked in television media as a technical support engineer and product trainer for hardware and software, working with TV stations all across the USA, and UK. After living in London for three years I came back home to New York and worked for a managed services provider as a systems engineer specializing in Windows Server and virtualization technology with clients all along the east coast. In my spare time I had the pleasure of writing articles and gadget reviews over at The Gadgeteer.\nIn 2017 I pivoted to become a full time web developer and found my current place of work where I started as an associate and part time developer. In 2021 I took a part time game development course via Code Coven to learn the foundations of Epic’s Unreal Engine and really enjoyed learning game making, design, and networking with folks from all over the world. Today I’m the digital director for a talented team of editors, writers, and developers in the health and wellness space.\nIn my spare time I like to tinker with code on my personal websites, livestream music mixes and games, practice photography when I travel, and am interested in cyber security. I plan to build this website as a digital garden based on my experiences in tech, creative projects, hobbies, and notes from all aspects of my life.\nNewsletter # I\u0026rsquo;ve started a small creative newsletter where I share personal art, sketches, photos, and cool websites that I\u0026rsquo;ve discovered. Sign up if you\u0026rsquo;d like, no funny business here!\nColophon # This site is powered by the SSG Hugo and the Blowfish Hugo template and hosted on Netlify.\nComments are powered by self-hosted Commentario.\nMy personal blog is hosted on Pika.page.\nI subscribe to Canva to edit the feature images and illustrations throughout the site.\nThe animated plant and leaf emoji are from Google\u0026rsquo;s Noto Emoji.\nContact Me # You can email me via this form or via \u0026ldquo;reply by email\u0026rdquo; on any page:\nSupport # If you like what I do and would like to send support, buy me a coffee!

I\u0026rsquo;ve been meaning to tend to.\nIn the beginning of 2024, I read the popular blog post by Maggie Appleton regarding digital gardens - an online space that can be considered a personal wiki, knowledgebase, notebook, or anything that collects data in your own organized way. I started the concept of a \u0026ldquo;digital cafe\u0026rdquo;, where I had a cute .cafe domain, but it ended up just being a blog and a bit linear. I then bought a million domains, each with new ideas, and went a bit scattered for many months in order to distract myself.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s now the end of the year, and I want to revisit the idea of creating a garden, with a cute theme, where I can gather all of my scattered thoughts into one place. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be neat, or make sense, just a proper home where I can collect all of the projects I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on seperately, such as saving links, drawings, cute illustrations, a collection of what books I\u0026rsquo;m into, shows/movies that I watch, games that I play, and code that I tinker with.\nIf I get into a rhythm, maybe this will even be the focus of a new main website, and the blog will be a subdomain of this. I won\u0026rsquo;t get ahead of myself yet though, since I get excited when I start something new. 😆 🌱\n","date":"December 1 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/notes/2024/beginning/","section":"All Notes","summary":"A digital home that\u0026rsquo;s ever changing.","title":"Beginning a Garden? 🌱","type":"notes"},{"content":" See more on binarydigit.some.pics or subscribe to the photo feed! # ","date":"December 1 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/photos/","section":"Welcome to my digital garden 🌱","summary":"A photo stream from some.pics","title":"Photo Feed","type":"page"},{"content":" Use these referral links for services I use and we both get discounts or credits! # Get 10% off your first year when you sign up for Fastmail.

For this site what I realize is that I absolutely love this theme and the customization of it all. Blowfish is incredible and comes with a lot of built in options! Now that I\u0026rsquo;ve tinkered with both 11ty and Hugo, I\u0026rsquo;m more familiar with file layouts, tinkering with the code, and am able to have a clearer vision of where I want my site to go. I think I\u0026rsquo;ll make another series for photos, projects, games etc, or keep them organized with tags and/or categories. I\u0026rsquo;ll eventually venture into customizing a layout or partial and really make it my own.\nI\u0026rsquo;m able to make this site more image heavy since I love color, creating backgrounds with Canva, posting images and making it fun all around. The theme has image optimization built in so I might as well take advantage of it. This website is not for the low bandwidth and I\u0026rsquo;m ok with that for a personal website. Be warned if on mobile. 😅\nI\u0026rsquo;ve started up Giscus comments again along with a \u0026ldquo;send a message\u0026rdquo; dropdown section for a Letterbird contact form. I subscribed for the year to show them support since I love how easy it is to embed and customize the form anywhere on the site, any webpage and it\u0026rsquo;s built in Scribbles.\nI also realize that when I\u0026rsquo;m ready to create for this website, I\u0026rsquo;ll take the time to open up my code editor and create a feature image, markdown, and write a proper post or article. The fast blogging will be kept on my blog, which is perfect. You can visit there for my daily/weekly blog posts!

Only recently I learned that you can use the Neocities API and CLI to push a site to your space! It\u0026rsquo;s awesome and available on the free tier.\nRecently I\u0026rsquo;ve seen more and more people on the supporter plan where you can host unlimited sites, have increased bandwidth, use custom domain names, and support open source and the small web. Today I decided to become a supporter since for $5 a month is a great value and I wanted to migrate my main websites from Netlify to Neocities.\nGitHub Actions # I\u0026rsquo;ve learned about GitHub Actions and realized this makes deployment much easier since I don\u0026rsquo;t have to push my code to GitHub and then push it to Neocities. A small task right now, but why not learn how to automate it, right?\nI ran across the every amazing website of Sophie Koonin and how she deployed her site using GitHub Actions. She explains perfectly how to get your Neocities key and add it to GitHub. The one problem I ran into was that Sophie uses 11ty, but I use Hugo on this site. After searching some more, I ran across John Bowdre\u0026rsquo;s blog post on how to Deploy a Hugo Site to Neocities with GitHub Actions - just what I needed!\nMy Workflow # I had to fiddle with my workflow but the below is what ended up working for me, since I don\u0026rsquo;t use the exact same setup as others:\nname: Deploy to Neocities on: push: branches: - main concurrency: group: deploy-to-neocities cancel-in-progress: true jobs: deploy: name: Build and deploy Hugo site runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - name: Hugo setup uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2.6.0 with: hugo-version: \u0026#39;0.121.1\u0026#39; extended: true - name: Checkout uses: actions/checkout@v4 with: submodules: recursive # Build the site with Hugo - name: Build with Hugo run: hugo --minify # Push public dir to Neocities and clean up any orphaned files - name: Deploy to Neocities uses: bcomnes/deploy-to-neocities@v1 with: api_token: ${{ secrets.NEOCITIES_TOKEN }} cleanup: true dist_dir: public I hope this helps you just like the blog posts above helped me get in the right direction!

I\u0026rsquo;m back already updating my post 😂\nI\u0026rsquo;ve found one feature that\u0026rsquo;s turned me off of Bear blog - There is no way to delete images once you upload them. I realize how much I want to upload images easily since I\u0026rsquo;m a visual person and really like sharing photos or cool images of things I like. So I\u0026rsquo;m back on Scribbles to test it since it\u0026rsquo;s super easy to do off of the things and it\u0026rsquo;s free for the moment. I\u0026rsquo;ve also re-enabled tinylitics since it\u0026rsquo;s a neat service and I do like the simple analytics that bear blog had.\nI\u0026rsquo;m sure I\u0026rsquo;ll update you all next week with different findings as I use more services 🤣\nOriginal Post: # My Week # During the week I was reading the 32bit cafe and Mastodon, and made a list of small web platforms that I wanted to try. Ever since I set up WordPress over again, I haven\u0026rsquo;t been happy with the experience. It\u0026rsquo;s bloated and slow, I only wrote a couple of posts, and I kept fiddling with themes and plugins instead of writing. I\u0026rsquo;m naturally a fiddler with code since I love making and changing aethestics of themes and things. The reason I\u0026rsquo;m looking for simple blogging software is to:\nBlog more, even if they are short random thoughts. I found my old Tumblr and WordPress archives and miss reading about those parts of my life. I don\u0026rsquo;t really want to update Hugo (running on this site) or 11ty for blogging, it\u0026rsquo;s too much work for a short post. I want a decent editor interface, with markdown and abiliity to upload photos and link from my personal gallery or some.pics. I want to be able to enjoy the writing experience with good simple UI I want to be able to change themes and then edit them as I want to - colors, fonts, links. I don\u0026rsquo;t mind spending up to $5-6 a month for a service, as long as I can export it when needed. I want to support the platform and feel that\u0026rsquo;s about what I\u0026rsquo;d pay. I had micro.blog which was great, I love the activitypub integration; but sometimes complicated with theming, also confusing when looking up profiles, and things broke more frequently than I wanted. Down to Three # I whittled it down to Scribbles, Pika, and Bear. All services that are specfically made for micro blogging and on the small web.\nI really loved the idea of Scribbles, other blog discoverability, and Vincent is wonderful and responsive, it just doesn\u0026rsquo;t have enough of the above features that I wanted right now. I will keep afloat on updates to that service for sure!\nI then signed up for Pika and Bear. I absolutely loved the easy UI of Pika. You sit down, pick a theme color, font, and you\u0026rsquo;re ready to go. You are able to adjust CSS as well, but I didn\u0026rsquo;t have much to change.\nWhen I signed up for Bear, immediately I noticed how much I could customize on the free tier. I\u0026rsquo;m able to not only customize how my blog looks to the reader, but how it look to me in the dashboard CSS! I can add a basic styling to buttons (since by default it\u0026rsquo;s quite \u0026hellip;bare🥁, and change the fonts and size while in the editor. It helps me tremendously. Herman has clear docs and for the pro plan at $5 a month you add a custom domain, image uploading (on the free tier you can only link from another source which is fine but not always ideal), has analytics (not a big deal for me but might be nice to check), run JS scripts, an email subscriber list (which I may or may not use), and ability to add code to the head and footer. You can also see a disovery list of other Bear blogs.\nFor me, the winner will be Bear. Pika is also still new, so I will also be keeping an eye out for updates from the team at Good Enough. I love what they do and currently signed up for Letterbird and Album Whale.\nI look forward to more updates from both Pika and Scribbles! And don\u0026rsquo;t be surprised if I write a new update in 6 months when I change my mind to another service. 😅\nIf you have any other small web blog platforms send them my way on Mastodon!
