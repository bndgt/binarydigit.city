I started the concept of a \u0026ldquo;digital cafe\u0026rdquo;, where I had a cute .cafe domain, but it ended up just being a blog and a bit linear. I then bought a million domains, each with new ideas, and went a bit scattered for many months in order to distract myself.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s now the end of the year, and I want to revisit the idea of creating a garden, with a cute theme, where I can gather all of my scattered thoughts into one place. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be neat, or make sense, just a proper home where I can collect all of the projects I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on seperately, such as saving links, drawings, cute illustrations, a collection of what books I\u0026rsquo;m into, shows/movies that I watch, games that I play, and code that I tinker with.\nIf I get into a rhythm, maybe this will even be the focus of a new main website, and the blog will be a subdomain of this. I won\u0026rsquo;t get ahead of myself yet though, since I get excited when I start something new. ðŸ˜† ðŸŒ±\n","date":"December 1 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/beginning/","section":"Posts","summary":"A digital home that\u0026rsquo;s ever changing.","title":"Beginning a Garden ðŸŒ±","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"December 1 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"Liz's Digital Garden","summary":"","title":"Liz's Digital Garden","type":"page"},{"content":"","date":"December 1 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts","type":"posts"},{"content":"","date":"December 1 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"},{"content":"","date":"December 1 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/thoughts/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Thoughts","type":"tags"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
