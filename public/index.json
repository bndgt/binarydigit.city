I became fascinated with how computers worked, how the web evolved, and started being online a bit too much!

I went to college to get my bachelors in Computer Science and find my way into a career of tech support, product training, systems engineering, and web development. For ten years I worked in television media as a technical support engineer and product trainer for hardware and software, working with TV stations all across the USA, and UK. After living in London for three years I came back home to New York and worked for a managed services provider as a systems engineer specializing in Windows Server and virtualization technology with clients all along the east coast. In my spare time I had the pleasure of writing articles and gadget reviews over at The Gadgeteer.\nIn 2017 I pivoted to become a full time web developer and found my current place of work where I started as an associate and part time developer. In 2021 I took a part time game development course via Code Coven to learn the foundations of Epicâ€™s Unreal Engine and really enjoyed learning game making, design, and networking with folks from all over the world. Today Iâ€™m the digital director for a talented team of editors, writers, and developers in the health and wellness space.\nIn my spare time I like to tinker with code on my personal websites, livestream music mixes and games, practice photography when I travel, and am interested in cyber security. I plan to build this website as a digital garden based on my experiences in tech, creative projects, hobbies, and notes from all aspects of my life.\nContact Me # You can email me via this form or via \u0026ldquo;reply by email\u0026rdquo; on any page\nSite Categorization # I\u0026rsquo;m going to use Maggie Appleton\u0026rsquo;s categorization technique:\nðŸŒ± Seedlings for very rough and early ideas\nðŸŒ¿ Budding for work that\u0026rsquo;s cleaned up and clarified\nðŸŒ³ Evergreen for work that is reasonably complete\nColophon # This site is powered by the SSG Hugo and Blowfish.

I started the concept of a \u0026ldquo;digital cafe\u0026rdquo;, where I had a cute .cafe domain, but it ended up just being a blog and a bit linear. I then bought a million domains, each with new ideas, and went a bit scattered for many months in order to distract myself.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s now the end of the year, and I want to revisit the idea of creating a garden, with a cute theme, where I can gather all of my scattered thoughts into one place. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t have to be neat, or make sense, just a proper home where I can collect all of the projects I\u0026rsquo;ve been working on seperately, such as saving links, drawings, cute illustrations, a collection of what books I\u0026rsquo;m into, shows/movies that I watch, games that I play, and code that I tinker with.\nIf I get into a rhythm, maybe this will even be the focus of a new main website, and the blog will be a subdomain of this. I won\u0026rsquo;t get ahead of myself yet though, since I get excited when I start something new. ðŸ˜† ðŸŒ±\n","date":"December 1 2024","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/posts/beginning/","section":"Posts","summary":"A digital home that\u0026rsquo;s ever changing.","title":"Beginning a Garden ðŸŒ±","type":"posts"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"This is the root of bookmarks\nlink one link two ","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/bookmarks/","section":"Bookmarks","summary":"","title":"Bookmarks","type":"bookmarks"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"this is the link page\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/bookmarks/link/","section":"Bookmarks","summary":"All about this website.","title":"Link","type":"bookmarks"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"}]
